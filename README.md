# About

Creating tables of contents for your GitHub README files by hand is time-consuming, error prone and monotonous. Use our Table of Contents Generator to alleviate the pain.

# How to Use

Just [visit the app](https://freelance-tech-writer.github.io/table-of-contents-generator/index.html), copy/paste your README in, then generate! You can also choose between ordered or unordered lists.

**Be aware!:** This uses the GitHub Markdown API, so you'll be limited to about 60 requests per hour. (You should really only need one or two, though!)

**Be aware!**: There will be edge-cases that the Generator doesn't handle so smoothly, like odd tags in your headings, out-of-order heading numbers, and more. You may need to tweak the output manually if you notice it seems slightly off.

# Inspiration

Although it shares no common code, [egalinin/github-markdown-toc](https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc) served as important inspiration and direction for this repository.
